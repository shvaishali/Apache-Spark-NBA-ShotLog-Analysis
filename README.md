The paths for the input channels must be changed to match the NBA dataset on the computer it is running on. This location must be modified in both the tactical test.sh file and the kmeans.py file.

The code will output the each player and their centroids. This solution is oriented towards the four players of interest: Lebron James, Chris Paul, Stephen Curry, and James Harden. The submitted code also presents the exploration of K-Values to demonstrate optimization concepts in machine learning.
